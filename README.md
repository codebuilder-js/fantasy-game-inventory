The data structure to model the playerâ€™s inventory will be a 
dictionary where the keys are string values describing the item 
in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing how 
many of that item the player has. For example, the dictionary 
value {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12} 
means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.
